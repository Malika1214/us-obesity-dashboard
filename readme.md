## Project Overview

This project is an interactive dashboard that shows adult obesity rates across U.S. counties and explores obesity patterns across the United States using interactive maps and charts. 

It helps users see how obesity differs by region and understand possible links with social and geographic factors. Instead of only showing data, the dashboard helps explain patterns and highlights areas that may need public health support.


It uses a choropleth map to visualize obesity percentages — darker colors mean higher obesity rates. Users can hover and click on counties to see detailed information, storytelling to turn data into meaningful insight , along with supporting charts and summary statistics.
