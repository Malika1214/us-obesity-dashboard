## Project Overview

This project is an interactive dashboard that shows **adult obesity rates across U.S. counties**.

It uses a choropleth map to visualize obesity percentages — darker colors mean higher obesity rates. Users can hover and click on counties to see detailed information, along with supporting charts and summary statistics.
